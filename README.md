# EDA-Project-Company-Bankruptcy-Pediction-
EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, it is basically an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. Here, I have analysed the Company Bankruptcy dataset. 

  TASK 1:    
  1.  What is the distribution of bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy classes in the dataset? Are the classes balanced or imbalanced?
  2.  How does the distribution of the "Operating Profit Rate" differ between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies? Can you create a suitable plot to visualize this difference?
  3.  Plot a bar graph to show how many companies are bankrupt or not(already asked in first ques)
  4.  Plot a countplot for Liability Assets Flag(use Bankrupt column for colour encoding)
  5.  Plot a heatmap without using the bankrupt column(using the seaborn lib)
  
  TASK 2:
  
  Perform following steps on the same dataset which you used for EDA.
  1.  Data Preprocessing (as per requirement)
  2.  Feature Engineering
  3.  Split dataset in train-test (80:20 ratio)
  4.  Model selection
  5.  Model training
  6.  Model evaluation
  7.  Fine-tune the Model
  8.  Make predictions

  Summarize your model's performance by evaluation metrices.
